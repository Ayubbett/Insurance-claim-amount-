## Insurance-claim-amount-

The project required one to predict the amount a customer would claim 
from an insurance company. This challenge came with data about the 
customer, their main bank used and their insurance cover. Using the CRISP 
DM methodology I was able to understand the problem and solve the 
problem using various machine learning models to get the best with a low 
mean absolute error which was the evaluation metric of the problem.
